        I started my Journey as a Frontend Developer in 2021, when i decided to create a layout for interest and began to study HTML and CSS, after i did a full layout, I realized that I want to do this professionally.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        That's why I signed up for courses, where I received a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge.Now I am applying this knowledge on an internship. Iâ€™m now looking for a junior dev position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.
